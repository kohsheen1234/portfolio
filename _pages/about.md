Hey, I'm Kohsheen! Currently pursuing Masters in [Financial Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/financial-engineering-ms) at New York University's [Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) '24, building on my  Computer Science undergrad degree from [BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore](https://www.bmsce.ac.in/) '20.


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.


Want a talk with me? Feel free to send me an email :D My availability can be queried at the published Outlook calendar.
